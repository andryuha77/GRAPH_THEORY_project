# GRAPH_THEORY_project
Single-page web application using the Flask framework for Data Representation project
The module is taught to undergraduate students at [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie) in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Physics.
The lecturer is [Ian McLoughlin](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io).

# Web Application Project
#### Data Representation and Querying Project 2016

### Project Overview
I have created a Single-Page Web Application (SPA) that lets users calculate BMI.
This application was selected after some deliberation.
Initially, I considered three different applications:

1. A [Power supply calculator](http://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator) alternative.
2. A [BMI calculator](http://www.bmicalculator.ie/) alternative.
3. A [Yelp](https://www.yelp.ie/) alternative.




### How to run the application
